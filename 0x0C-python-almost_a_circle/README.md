### Python - Almost a Circle project
This project is to prepare us for the AirBnB project, which is a big part of the higher level curriculum. This project is for us to review everything about Python:
- import
- exceptions
- class
- private attributes
- getter/setter
- class method
- static method
- inheritance
- unittest
- read/write file

We also learned these new things:
- `args` and `kwargs`
- serialization/deserialization
- JSON
